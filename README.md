Indoor location system using acoustic signals.

In this repository, codes and documentation regarding the acoustic based device discovery and location is built and collaborated. The documentation includes brief theoretical background on the design decisions and also flow charts of the algorithms used in detection and broadcasting of the acoustic signals.
